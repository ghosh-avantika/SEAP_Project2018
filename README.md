# SEAP Project 2018-2019
All of the files from the Science and Engineering Apprenticeship Program Summer Program 2018, including the algorithms that was created to test the dataset and the final presentation that was presented at the CSU Monterey Bay Research Symposium. 
This project involved using three machine learning algorithms, K-Means Clustering, Linear Regression, and Density-based Spatial Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), to identify anomalous or suspicious behavior in naval aircrafts given a set of 67 features. The original dataset used for this project contained 10,000 aircrafts from the ADS-B Exchange.
